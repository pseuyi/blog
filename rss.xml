(a book i wanted to read on kindle in sep 2019 from oreilly that they claim would not be released until july 2020)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;getting motivated&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;while i had heard about the recurse center years ago and even visited i didn’t actually learn very much of the admissions process until this year. i had been considering doing the program but i didn’t get motivated until after meeting with a few rc grads while i was in berlin for jsconf eu in early june. the perspective i got from them was that i was not alone in feeling like i wasn’t skilled enough in programming to make good use of a self directed program. i personally felt most deterred by my own lack of focus and direction in any particular technical subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i was already getting depressed after attending !!con in nyc a few weeks before my berlin trip. while i was inspired by the talks there i was becoming quite sad at what a joyless routine coding had become for me personally. for a few months i built up a lot of internal pressure to get interested in programming again and find ways to manifest something (anything) interesting to me in code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘we think we understand the rules when we become adults but what we really experience is a narrowing of the imagination.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i put this quote in my rc application somewhere and while it feels like such a corny thing to do i was really feeling nagged by it at the time. in the fall, the climate strike happened in nyc and the urgency of everyone who participated was deeply affecting to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;applying&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the rc application is both really long and really short. writing is weirdly difficult for me and takes forever so actually i spent quite a long time reading over the written application before sending it off. this part has a couple open-ended questions like ‘what is something that you find fascinating’ in addition to coding samples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;visiting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;if you’re lucky enough to be in nyc, rc hosts monthly lightning talks (localhost) where you can take a tour and see what folks are working on in batch. i went while i was applying to make sure the space still seemed like a good place for me to do the work i intend to do. and yes, it was a super friendly environment with many interesting people of every background. i went to localhost with a friend and notably someone who was in a current batch realized that they knew my friend from years ago through the wifi network (didn’t know this but iOs let’s you share wifi credentials when your contacts are nearby?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;interviews&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;given that most software jobs require hours of investment in coding challenges and day-long on sites, rc has an extremely slim interview process that takes place via video conference. one is conversational and the other is a pairing session. i personally felt like the conversational portion was just me ranting for 20 minutes straight about random things in and becoming really itchy and irritated in a poisonous phone booth. i was asked about both technical interests and approaches as well as more basic ‘why do you want to attend’ type stuff. i told my interview that i was nervous about getting laid off soon and they were very accomodating of this uncertainty. i was invited to schedule a pairing interview later that day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;for the pairing interview i decided to bring my own code which was good and bad. i had built a tic tac toe game before and really did not feel like doing that (lol). and anyway i was in the process of writing a script to convert web-only books to pdf and just really wanted to make it work.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[backfilling 2]]></title><description><![CDATA[i created this blog because i want to share with you the things that i’ll be working on. this could be code or just thoughts on what i’m…]]></description><link>https://recursive-buckwheat.surge.sh/backfilling-2/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://recursive-buckwheat.surge.sh/backfilling-2/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 13 Oct 2019 23:38:11 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i created this blog because i want to share with you the things that i’ll be working on. this could be code or just thoughts on what i’m learning. on oct. 31 i’ll be leaving my job to attend &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.recurse.com/&quot;&gt;the Recurse Center&lt;/a&gt;, a self-directed retreat for programmers. this blog will be a means through which i can document my life as a programmer and to hold myself accountable. for the next few months i have 2 main goals: understanding compilers and being a better listener.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i’ve decided to blog instead of tweet (my only other social media thing) because i hope it can allow for deeper, more interesting, reflections on my experience. for the last 2.5 years i kept a quiver notebook, titled ‘dev log’, where i wrote down what i did each day: technical contributions, links to interesting stuff, and anything i felt i would forget easily. i haven’t had the time to really process in total what was happening in my dev log until now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in the beginning, i often recorded problems i was working on and who i thought i should talk to in order to solve them. sometimes i would include implementation ideas or just things to ‘look into’. for example, on feb. 14 2018 i wrote down &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;look into babel transform-async-function&lt;/code&gt; while working on feature that asynchronously sent test emails. in the last year, however, my log slowly transformed from the notes of a programmer into task lists that served more as a document of what to repeat at standup than anything else. these lists would frequently be punctuated by long paragraphs processing either very intense meetings or individual encounters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;overall, one of the most common ‘tasks’ i documented include a variety of rake tasks in different rails services to backfill missing data following a migration. the reason this post is titled &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;backfilling 2&lt;/code&gt; is because this is the 2nd time i’ve deviated from life as a working adult to learn things that i wish i knew or otherwise felt like was missing in my intellectual life. plus, i kind of love the sisyphean imagery of filling something with what used to be there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i’ve decided after careful consideration that RC is the best place for me to backfill programming to my brain. when i imagined moving on from my first job as a software engineer to the next one, i realized that the primary allure of this fantasy rested on either a) proving to others i could find a better job than my current one, b) proving to others that i could obtain better pay or, c) some combination of a) and b). this felt super extrinsic to me, my needs, and my desire to connect with like-minded individuals. i feel really lucky that i can afford to navel gaze this hard while living in nyc and will be doing my best to not take that for granted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TODO: i will try to document soon what the rc admissions process was like and thoughts on my last job.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
