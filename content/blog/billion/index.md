in 2017 i was looking for my first job as a software engineer and to my surprise had the choice to work either on enterprise blockchain software or on community building tools for a coworking company. it was a really obvious decision at the time since the coworking company was growing and recently hired a cto from spotify while the media was expressing serious doubts in the viability of cryptocurrency.

my personal website at the time stated that my interests were in 'new media, creative coding, and frameworks for social progress' and working for a company that actively supported freelancers across new york city and the world seemed the closest to my personal and professional values. 

## what i learned working at a multi billion dollar start up

# organization

- finance is still a field requiring immense imagination
- woke language goes only so far, and in fact engaging only in discourse is a good indication that action is being avoided
- interview questions in our industry should have purpose beyond being 'solvable'

# engineering

- rails (not ruby)
- design patterns save time
- css and end-to-end testing are worthwhile
- adding dependencies is easy but costly

# collaboration

- type systems and lint rules create consistency for large codebases
- onboarding is different for different engineers

# people

- engineers need time to think but they like to be heard
- folks actually do need community and honest communication is really important to connect people
- it's important to have an environment that encourages curiosity. in practice this means being able to safely make mistakes


# space

- bathrooms are important places
- monitors, standing desks, private offices, etc seem necessary to do work but if work is intrinsically interesting none of these are as critical as a quite area
