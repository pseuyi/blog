i created this blog because i want to share with you the things that i'll be working on. this could be code or just thoughts on what i'm learning. on oct. 31 i'll be leaving my job to attend [the Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/), a self-directed retreat for programmers. this blog will be a means through which i can document my life as a programmer and to hold myself accountable. for the next few months i have 2 main goals: understanding compilers and being a better listener.

i've decided to blog instead of tweet (my only other social media thing) because i hope it can allow for deeper, more interesting, reflections on my experience. for the last 2.5 years i kept a quiver notebook, titled 'dev log', where i wrote down what i did each day: technical contributions, links to interesting stuff, and anything i felt i would forget easily. i haven't had the time to really process in total what was happening in my dev log until now.

in the beginning, i often recorded problems i was working on and who i thought i should talk to in order to solve them. sometimes i would include implementation ideas or just things to 'look into'. for example, on feb. 14 2018 i wrote down `look into babel transform-async-function` while working on feature that asynchronously sent test emails. in the last year, however, my log slowly transformed from the notes of a programmer into task lists that served more as a document of what to repeat at standup than anything else. these lists would frequently be punctuated by long paragraphs processing either very intense meetings or individual encounters.

overall, one of the most common 'tasks' i documented include a variety of rake tasks in different rails services to backfill missing data following a migration. the reason this post is titled `backfilling 2` is because this is the 2nd time i've deviated from life as a working adult to learn things that i wish i knew or otherwise felt like was missing in my intellectual life. plus, i kind of love the sisyphean imagery of filling something with what used to be there.

i've decided after careful consideration that RC is the best place for me to backfill programming to my brain. when i imagined moving on from my first job as a software engineer to the next one, i realized that the primary allure of this fantasy rested on either a) proving to others i could find a better job than my current one, b) proving to others that i could obtain better pay or, c) some combination of a) and b). this felt super extrinsic to me, my needs, and my desire to connect with like-minded individuals. i feel really lucky that i can afford to navel gaze this hard while living in nyc and will be doing my best to not take that for granted.
